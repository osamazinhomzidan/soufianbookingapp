# User Security Management Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Implement comprehensive CRUD operations for user management with a dedicated Security tab in the sidebar accessible only to OWNER users.

## Current Analysis

### Existing Structure
- ✅ User model exists in Prisma schema with proper fields (id, username, email, password, role, etc.)
- ✅ Authentication system implemented with JWT tokens
- ✅ Role-based access control (OWNER/STAFF) in place
- ✅ Sidebar component with role filtering functionality
- ✅ API patterns established (hotels, rooms, bookings) for reference

### User Model Fields (Current)
```prisma
model User {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  username  String   @unique
  email     String   @unique
  password  String   // hashed password
  role      UserRole @default(STAFF)
  firstName String?
  lastName  String?
  phone     String?
  isActive  Boolean  @default(true)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  // Relations...
}
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Schema Analysis and Updates (if needed) ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Description**: Review current User model and determine if any schema updates are required.

**Analysis Results**:
The current User model contains all necessary fields for comprehensive CRUD operations:
- ✅ `id` (String, @id, @default(cuid()))
- ✅ `username` (String, @unique)
- ✅ `email` (String, @unique)
- ✅ `password` (String, hashed)
- ✅ `role` (UserRole: OWNER/STAFF, @default(STAFF))
- ✅ `firstName` (String?, optional)
- ✅ `lastName` (String?, optional)
- ✅ `phone` (String?, optional)
- ✅ `isActive` (Boolean, @default(true))
- ✅ `createdAt` (DateTime, @default(now()))
- ✅ `updatedAt` (DateTime, @updatedAt)
- ✅ Proper relations with bookings, hotels, and rooms

**Tasks**:
- [x] Analyze current User model fields
- [x] Determine if additional fields are needed for comprehensive user management
- [x] Update schema if necessary - **NO UPDATES NEEDED**
- [x] Run Prisma migration if changes made - **NOT REQUIRED**

**Validation Checklist**:
- [x] Schema supports all required CRUD operations
- [x] All necessary fields present for user management
- [x] Relations properly maintained
- [x] Migration runs successfully (if needed) - **NOT NEEDED**

**Conclusion**: The existing User model is complete and ready for CRUD operations. No schema modifications required.
