# Hotel Management Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for enhancing the hotel management system with the following features:
- Location input field (separate from address)
- Multiple file attachment support for agreements
- Advanced filtering capabilities for hotel location and all hotel data
- Room count display in hotel list
- Filter for hotels that have rooms

## Project Structure Analysis

### Current Files to Modify:
1. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema updates
2. `src/app/api/hotels/route.ts` - Main hotels API endpoint
3. `src/app/api/hotels/[id]/route.ts` - Individual hotel API endpoint
4. `src/app/(owner)/hotel/page.tsx` - Frontend hotel management page
5. `src/lib/translations.ts` - Translation updates
6. `prisma/seed.js` - Seed data updates

### Current Hotel Model Structure:
- Basic fields: id, name, altName, code, description, altDescription, address
- Relations: amenities, rooms, bookings, createdBy
- Missing: location field, agreement files support

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Database Schema Updates ✅ PENDING
**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

**Changes Required:**
1. Add `location` field to Hotel model (String, optional)
2. Create new `HotelAgreement` model for file attachments:
   ```prisma
   model HotelAgreement {
     id        String   @id @default(cuid())
     hotelId   String
     fileName  String
     filePath  String
     fileSize  Int
     mimeType  String
     uploadedAt DateTime @default(now())
     
     hotel Hotel @relation(fields: [hotelId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
     
     @@map("hotel_agreements")
   }
   ```
3. Add `agreements HotelAgreement[]` relation to Hotel model

**Validation Steps:**
- [ ] Run `npx prisma db push` to apply schema changes
- [ ] Verify no syntax errors in schema
- [ ] Check that relations are properly defined
- [ ] Ensure foreign key constraints work correctly
