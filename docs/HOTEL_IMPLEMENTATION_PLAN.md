# Hotel Management Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed step-by-step plan to update the Hotel model in the Prisma schema, create RESTful API endpoints, and integrate them with the frontend hotel management page.

## Current Analysis

### Frontend Requirements (from hotel/page.tsx)
The hotel interface currently uses these fields:
- `id`: string (unique identifier)
- `name`: string (primary hotel name)
- `code`: string (hotel code like 'GPH001')
- `altName`: string (alternative/Arabic name)
- `address`: string (hotel address)
- `createdAt`: string (creation date)

### Current Prisma Schema Issues
The current Hotel model has many additional fields that are not used in the frontend:
- `description`, `city`, `country`, `phone`, `email`, `rating` - not used in frontend
- Missing `altDescription` field that should be added
- Relations with `createdBy`, `rooms`, `bookings`, `amenities` should be preserved

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Analyze Current Hotel Model ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Description**: Thoroughly analyze the current Hotel model in the Prisma schema to understand existing relations and dependencies.

**Tasks**:
- Review current Hotel model fields
- Identify which fields are used in frontend vs backend
- Document all existing relations that must be preserved
- Note any potential breaking changes

**Validation**: 
- [x] All current Hotel model fields documented
- [x] All relations identified and documented
- [x] Frontend-backend field mapping completed

**Completed Work**:
- Analyzed existing Hotel model in schema.prisma
- Identified unused fields: city, country, phone, email, rating, isActive
- Documented required fields: name, altName, code, description, altDescription, address
- Preserved all existing relations with User, Room, Booking, and HotelAmenity models

### Step 2: Update Hotel Model in Prisma Schema ✅
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Description**: Update the Hotel model to match frontend requirements while preserving existing relations.

**Required Fields**:
- `id`: String @id @default(cuid())
- `name`: String (hotel name)
- `altName`: String (alternative hotel name)
- `code`: String @unique (hotel code)
- `description`: String? (hotel description)
- `altDescription`: String? (alternative hotel description)
- `address`: String (hotel address)
- `createdAt`: DateTime @default(now())
- `updatedAt`: DateTime @updatedAt
- `createdById`: String (for relation)

**Relations to Preserve**:
- `createdBy`: User relation
- `rooms`: Room[] relation
- `bookings`: Booking[] relation
- `amenities`: HotelAmenity[] relation

**Completed Work**:
- ✅ Removed unused fields: city, country, phone, email, rating, isActive
- ✅ Added altDescription field
- ✅ Updated schema.prisma with correct Hotel model structure
- ✅ All relations preserved intact
- ✅ Schema validated and working correctly

**Validation**:

## PROMPT FOR ROOM MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION

To implement the same comprehensive system for Room Management (`src/app/(owner)/room/page.tsx`), use this prompt:

```
Implement a complete Room Management system with API integration for the existing room page. The current room page uses local state management and needs to be converted to use RESTful API endpoints with proper database integration.

Requirements:
1. **Analyze Current Room Model**: Review the existing Room model in Prisma schema and identify required fields based on the frontend interface
2. **Update Room Schema**: Modify the Room model to match frontend requirements while preserving existing relations
3. **Create Room API Endpoints**: Implement comprehensive CRUD API endpoints at `/api/rooms` and `/api/rooms/[id]`
4. **Frontend Integration**: Update the room page to use API calls instead of local state
5. **Update Seed Data**: Modify seed.js to work with the updated Room model
6. **Testing**: Thoroughly test all functionality

The room interface currently includes:
- Hotel selection (relationship with Hotel model)
- Room type and descriptions (including alt descriptions)
- Pricing (base price and alternative pricing)
- Board types (Room only, Bed & breakfast, Half board, Full board)
- Quantity management
- Seasonal pricing support

Ensure the implementation follows the same patterns used in the Hotel management system, including:
- Proper error handling and validation
- Loading states and user feedback
- Support for filtering and search
- Bulk operations
- Arabic text support
- Responsive UI design

Create a detailed implementation plan similar to HOTEL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and execute all steps systematically.
```
